# Repository Structure

After `git clone https://github.com/Master-Chen-Xin-Qi/EuroSys26_AE.git`, you will see the directory structure shown below:

- `data` folder contains the dataset needed for AE. The data corresponding to each figure is saved in a subfolder like `fig3`.
- `pic` folder contains the pictures generated by the code.
- `src` contains the code like `plot_figxxx.py` to generate the figures in our paper.
- `requirements.txt` contains the dependencies for the code.

```txt

```

# Reproduce the Results

To reproduce the figures in our paper, you can run the following command:

```bash
cd src
python plot_figxxx.py
```

where `xxx` is the figure number.

# Block I/O Traces

We have open-sourced the VD I/O traces collected from our production EBS clusters. Please refer to [Tianchi](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/210122) for more information of our dataset.

# Omar Prototype

The core scheduling strategy code of Omar is included in the `omar` folder, and users could plug Omar in their block storage system's scheduling framework easily. Please refer to this [doc](./omar/docs/README.md) for more details.
